# RuleSets for all-optical quantum repeaters

Before we dive into individual RuleSets for various types of network nodes we go over the notation used in this document.

We begin with the __repeater graph state (RGS)__:

</center>

The RGS is given by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Big|G(m,\vec{b})\rangle"> as shown in the Figure 1. It consists of two types of vertices. Orange vertices represent 1st leaf qubits which are encoded using a tree encoding with a branching vector denoted by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec{b}=(b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n)">.
The blue vertices represent physical qubits, usually called 2nd leaf qubits or arm qubits.
Total number of physical qubits for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Big|G(m,\vec{b})\rangle"> is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_l=2m [\sum_{j=0}^n\product_{i=0}^jb_{i}%2B1]">.
The example shown in Figure 1 with m=3 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec{b}=(3,2)"> contains 60 physical qubits.

The __network link__ is shown in the following figure:

</center>

Each link consists of three types of nodes:
* __RGS node__ generates the photonic RGS using matter qubits and sends one half of the qubits to its neighbor to the right and the other half of the qubits to the left.
* __Mesurement node__ or __Advanced Bell State Analyzer (ABSA)__ receives one half of a RGS from boths its neighboring RGS nodes. The ABSA then measures the arm qubits in Bell basis. Depending on the outcome of the Bell mesurements the orange qubits are then measured in corresponding Pauli X or Pauli Z basis. The network link is composed of alternative RGS nodes and ABSA nodes.
* __End nodes__ of the link are the nodes trying to establish a shared entangled pair. [Comment: their precise functionality still needs to be discussed and determined. For now we assume they receive one half of a RGS from the neighboring RGS node.]


## 1. Repeater nodes

__Assumptions:__
* We assume that the emissions times are such that the arrival of qubits at the ABSA nodes will be synchronized.*

__Overview:__  
The source node receives the required time of emission of all physical qubits.
The emission schedule is such that the physical qubits arrive at the neighboring ABSA nodes in a synchrony with physical qubits from another source node.
This synchronized timing is crucial to the Bell measurements and must be carefully calculated prior to the start of the protocol.

The source node also receives the parameters m describing the number of arms of the RGS and the branching vector for the encoding of 1st leaf qubits.
It then proceeds to generate the RGS accordingly.


## 2. ABSA nodes

__Assumptions:__
* We assume that the arrival of qubits at the ABSA is appropriately synchronized. *[Comment: Need to discuss how to synchronize the distribution of RGS across the link.]*

__Overview:__  
The RuleSet for ABSA nodes depends on the order of arrival of qubits from the source nodes. A pair of arm qubits arrive first from the left and right source nodes followed by their respective 1st-leaft neighbors as shown in Figure 3.

The explicit time schedule is also shown in Figure 3.
Each orange block represents <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_l"> physical qubits corresponding to a single logical qubit.
The physical qubits constituting one logical qubit arrive in a way shown in Figure 3.


__Indirect Z measurement:__

Local Pauli measurements can be performed in a fault-tolerant manner on logical qubits encoded using a tree graph state as shown in Figure 1.
An indirect Z measurement can be used even after a failed direct Z measurement or after the qubit to be measured had been lost.

Figure 4 shows an indirect Z measurement. The parity of a failed Z measurement on qubit (i,j) can be inferred from a successful X measurement on any of the qubits on level i+1 that are leafs of qubit (i,j), and subsequent Z measurements (direct or indirect) on their leafs on level i+2. Figure 4 shows a successful inidirect measurement on qubit (i,j) despite two of the attempts having failed on subtree B and subtree C. Parity of the Z measurement on qubit (i,j) is given by the total parity of X and Z measurements on qubits of level i+1 and level i+2.

__Encoded measurements:__

The 1st-leaf qubits of an RGS ar eencoded in a tree structure and therefore have to be measured using encoded Pauli operators as shown in Figure 5.

</center>


Encoded Z measurement is performed by measuring all Level 1 qubits in Z basis, Level 2 qubits in X basis, Level 3 qubits in Z basis and so on.
The encoded measurement succeeds if all Level 1 qubits are measured successfully (either via direct or indirect Z measurements).

Encoded X measurement is performed by measuring all Level 1 qubits in X basis, Level 2 qubits in Z basis, Level 3 qubits in X basis and so on.
The encoded measurement succeeds if at least one of the Level 1 X measurements is successful and all its Level 2 leafs are successfully measured in Z (either via direct or indirect measurements).

## 3. End nodes

__Overview:__  
Functionality of the end nodes depends on the purpose of the network link.
Two main applications that we consider are quantum key distribution (QKD) and entanglement distribution.

__QKD__  
The purpose of quantum key distributin is to generate a classical random key.
Therefore the incoming photonic qubits can be measured immediately upon arrival.
In general, these measurements occur before the arrival of measurement transcripts from all ABSA nodes along the network link.
This does not compromise the protocol as the correct Pauli frame can be worked out by classical postprocessing.

__Entanglement distribution__  
In this scenario the goal is to establish an entangled pair between the two end nodes.

1. The incoming arm qubits therefore must be stored in a quantum memory. [Comment: How to do this?]
2. The 1st-leaf qubits can be measured immediately as they arrive or they can be stored in a quantum memory as well. Only one of the 1st-leaf qubits needs to be measured in an encoded Pauli X basis. It does not matter which one it is, as long as its arm-qubit neighbor was successfully stored in a quantum memory.

Issue:  
Consider the case where the 1st-leaf qubits are immediately measured upon arrival.
Following the first successful storing of an arm qubit in a quantum memory, its 1st-leaf neighbor must be measured in an encoded Pauli X basis and the remaining 1st-leaf qubits in encoded Pauli Z basis.
This means that the arm qubit that will eventually become entangled with an arm qubit at the other end node will be one of the earlier qubits that had arrived at the end node.
This arm qubit undergoes more decoherence because it has to stay in the memory for longer.
Consequently the final fidelity of the entangled pair between the end nodes suffers.

Goal:  
Ideally, we would like the last successfully stored arm qubit to be the one used to establish an entangled link to the other end node.

Potential solution:  
Store 1st-leaf qubits in quantum memory as well.
Determine which arm qubit was succesfully loaded last and measure its neighbor in the encoded Pauli X basis and measure the remaining stored qubits in Pauli Z basis.
If this X measurement fails, move on to the second last successfully stored arm qubit and attempt to measure its 1-st leaf neighbor in the encoded Pauli X basis.
Continue until the encoded X measurement succeeds.
