# Background on Network Topology

If the topologies to be created are artificial, then these references are invaluable:

    abstract = {The search for unifying properties of complex networks is
                  popular, challenging, and important. For modeling
                  approaches that focus on robustness and fragility as
                  unifying concepts, the Internet is an especially
                  attractive case study, mainly because its
                  applications are ubiquitous and pervasive, and
                  widely available expositions exist at every level of
                  detail. Nevertheless, alternative approaches to
                  modeling the Internet often make extremely different
                  assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about
                  fundamental properties of one and the same
                  system. Fortunately, a detailed understanding of
                  Internet technology combined with a unique ability
                  to measure the network means that these differences
                  can be understood thoroughly and resolved
                  unambiguously. This article aims to make recent
                  results of this process accessible beyond Internet
                  specialists to the broader scientific community and
                  to clarify several sources of basic methodological
                  differences that are relevant beyond either the
                  Internet or the two specific approaches focused on
                  here (i.e., scale-free networks and highly optimized
                  tolerance networks).
