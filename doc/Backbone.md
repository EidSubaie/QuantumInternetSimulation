# Research question #

*Note: this file is an early design document, and we are still working on this file.
If you are interested in the basis idea behind QUISP (this quantum internet simulation package),please refer to the  [Internet Draft by Van Meter & Matsuo](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-van-meter-qirg-quantum-connection-setup-01)
(which, as of this writing, has expired, but will be revived).*

Does one particular technology make a better backbone?

What's a "backbone" in this context?

1. High throughput links
1. Capable of long distances
1. Supports many concurrent connections
1. Generally low-degree nodes
