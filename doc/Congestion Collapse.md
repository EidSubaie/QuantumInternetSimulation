# Research question: Congestion Collapse #

Does the quantum equivalent of congestion collapse exist? (We have a strong intuition that the answer here is "yes" for anything other than circuit switching, but we need to characterize it.)

This is the macro-level problem, for the network as a whole. It is somewhat related to the incast problem under [Competition for Resources](Competition%20for%20Resources.md).
