# Research question #

Are there cases where two nodes both exist on the internetwork, but they can't connect?

e.g., Japan can connect to the U.S., and the U.S. can connect to Brazil, but Japan can't successfully connect to Brazil. Or, like having a TCP timeout of 20ms, so short that you can't connect.

Reference: Hartmann et al., PRA 75 (2007), on effect of memory lifetime on purify & swap repeater distances.
