# Software Design for QuISP

As we saw while [code spelunking](code-spelunking.md), the source code
is also [documented using doxygen](html/index.html).  You may wish to
attempt to match items from these design documents to some of the
code.

n.b.: Most of these design documents were created in a couple of
extended bursts of group work, actually quite some time ago.  After
that design work, implementation proceeded with most of the core
elements of the design intact, but we all know that a design never
survives the first attempt to implement it unaltered.  If you find
places where these docs differ from reality, we encourage you to
submit pull requests to make one conform to the other -- which way, we
will leave to your judgment.

Also, these designs document a dream: the initial releases are _far_
from completing all of this!  Especially, as of this writing, only
first-generation (1G) repeaters are implemented _at all_.  2G and 3G
are Future Work.
