# Types of Quantum Repeater Networks Supported #

*Note: This is an old design document, which we expect to still be useful, but it may or may not correspond well to the current implementation.

## Dur-Briegel, purify-and-swap ##

* [FlatPathSetup Processing](FlatPathSetup%20Processing.md)is designed for this.

## Jiang, CSS QEC with swapping ##

* [FlatPathSetup Processing](FlatPathSetup%20Processing.md) should work with this, with an appropriate [RuleSet](RuleSet.md).
* Will require additional types of rules to accommodate QEC.

## Fowler, surface code "stretch and split" ##

* Will require slightly different semantics in RuleSets?
