QuISP builds upon and contributes to the research literature on quantum repeaters.

## The bible

The most important document on QuISP design and use is

* Takaaki Matsuo, "Simulation of a Dynamic, RuleSet-based Quantum
	Network", master's thesis, Keio University Graduate School of
	Media and Governance, Sept. 2019.
	Available as [arXiv:1908.10758

## General references

If you need to know about generations and stages of development,
carrying us from single-application quantum key distribution (QKD)
networks to a full Quantum Internet, see these three:

## Specific design decisions

In addition to Takaaki's thesis, the design decisions incorporated
here have evolved over fifteen years, and can be found in Rodney Van
Meter's research papers.
