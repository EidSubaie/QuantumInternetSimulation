*Note: this file is an early design document, but will be updated in the future.*

Connection creation consists of three components:

- Path selection ([[Routing]])
- [[Resource Allocation]]
- [[Role Assignment]]

We will begin with flat versions of all three, at least for pedagogical purposes, then extend to recursive.

Once a connection is created, of course, we want to operate it. See [Repeater Operation](Repeater Operation) and [Router Operation](Router Operation).
