# Hardware Element Simulation #

*Note: This is an old design document, which we expect to still be useful, but it may or may not correspond well to the current implementation.

See also the list of [hardware elements](Hardware%20Elements.md). 

Depends on the [God Channel](God%20Channel) for simulating measurements on any distributed quantum state.

Methods here called from [Real-Time Hardware Controller](Real-Time%20Hardware%20Controller.md).

Related, of course, to [QNIC Methods](QNIC_Methods).
