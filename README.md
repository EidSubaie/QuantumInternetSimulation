# QUISP

**TODO** PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## Installing requirements

QUISP requires OmNET++ and external C++ libraries to work. The full installation
process is described in [doc/INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md).

## Building and running

There are two main ways of working with QUISP. You can either use the Eclipse-like
graphical interface of OmNET++, for which you will find instructions in
[doc/USAGE-omnetpp-gui.md](doc/USAGE-omnetpp-gui.md), or you can use the `Makefile` and GNU make,
by looking at instructions in [doc/USAGE-makefile.md](doc/USAGE-makefile.md). Some operations are
implemented in the Makefile and not explained for the graphical user interface.

## Development tools

A few tools (mainly scripts) can be used to make development a bit easier.
Look around in the `bin` folder of this project.

## Others
Kaaki's latest version used for the master's thesis is accessible in the LinkLayerProtocol branch.
(Master is quite old now...)
